The following node modules are required:
- mime
- mqtt
- websocket.io
- ws

Install these to the root folder so that both the client and the server code can use it.

Running the example:
(1) Start the mosquitto server with the command "mosquitto --verbose"
(2) Start the OSGi application which is responsible for controlling the robot arm. The launch configuration can be found 
    in the org.franca.examples.mqtt.control plug-in under the name franca_mqtt.launch.
(3) Start the JS server application with the command "node server.js" 
(4) Start the JS client application from the browser by simply opening the index.html file
